# Vacation Final Project

Welcome to my Vacation Final Project! 🎉

you can explore the platform [here](https://tamir-vacations.onrender.com) and start your vacation adventure today. 🏝️🌞✈️

## Part 1: Project Overview

This project is all about making vacation planning and management more convenient and enjoyable. I've created a Vacation Tagging System that empowers users to:

- Register on the platform.
- Explore and filter vacations based on chronological time.
- Follow and unfollow vacation listings.
- Easily filter vacations by their start and end dates and whether the user is following them or not.

As an admin, you have additional capabilities:

- Edit, add, or delete vacations.
- Monitor and download reports that contain the vacation destinations and the number of her followers. this report is available in CSV format for download and suitable for viewing in Excel.

## Part 2: Technology Stack

I've utilized advanced technologies to make this platform a reality.

### Client-side:

- I've used TypeScript code for Client-side.
- My front-end is built with React, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.
- I've integrated various libraries like React Router for smooth navigation and Jest for testing the application.
- For a responsive design, I've incorporated React-Bootstrap.
- To create a dynamic chart I used the react-chartjs-2 library.

### Server-side:

- On the server side, I've also used TypeScript.
- Node.js powers the server, allowing for fast and efficient handling of requests and data.

### Database:

- Initially, I used a local MySQL database for data storage.
- After that, the site was uploaded to the cloud, thus the database had to be transferred to PostgreSQL.
